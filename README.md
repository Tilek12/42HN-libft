**Makefile**      - NAME, all, clean, fclean, re\
**External functs.** - Detailed below\
**Libft authorized** -  n/a\
**Description**      - Write your own library: a collection of functions that will be a useful tool for your cursus.

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **Part 1 - Libc functions**

Redo a set of functions from the libc. Functions have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals.\
They comply with the way they are defined in their man. The only difference will be their names.\
They begin with the ’ft_’ prefix. For instance, strlen becomes ft_strlen.

You must write your own function implementing the following original ones. They do not require any external functions:
- isalpha
- isdigit
- isalnum
- isascii
- isprint
- strlen
- memset
- bzero
- memcpy
- memmove
- strlcpy
- strlcat
- toupper
- tolower
- strchr
- strrchr
- strncmp
- memchr
- memcmp
- strnstr
- atoi\
In order to implement the two following functions, you will use malloc():
- calloc
- strdup
